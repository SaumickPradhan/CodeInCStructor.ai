# GPT-4 Coding Assistant

GPT-4 Coding Assistant is a web application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to help developers with their coding tasks. The application serves as an interactive chatbot that assists in code generation, understanding, and troubleshooting. It also utilizes embeddings and the Annoy library to search for similar code snippets in the provided codebase, offering more contextually relevant responses.
