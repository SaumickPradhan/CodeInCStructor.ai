## Team Name: Saumick Pradhan (Individual Project)
> Working with Dr Raj Bhatnagar and Dr Will Hawkins on a project tentatively titled "AI in Classroom". We will be addressing challenges a new programmer faces while starting to code. Our preliminary discussions included ideas of suggestive learning, discord bots, providing AI support with syntax error handling, etc.
