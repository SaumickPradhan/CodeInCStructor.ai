# TEST PLAN

# Description of Overall Test Plan
The overall test plan for CodeInCStructor.ai employs a multi-level testing strategy to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the platform. The testing includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. <br>

Unit tests focus on individual components, ensuring they perform as expected. Integration tests examine the interaction between subsystems, ensuring seamless collaboration. System tests evaluate the entire platform's functionality, covering end-to-end scenarios. <br>

Additionally, both blackbox and whitebox testing methodologies are applied to validate external and internal behaviors. Functional testing ensures that features meet user requirements, while performance testing assesses the system's responsiveness under different workloads. The testing plan is designed to verify that CodeInCStructor.ai meets the project's goals and satisfies user stories.


# Test Case Descriptions
List a series of 10-25 tests for validating your project outcomes. For each test case provide the following:
1.  test case identifier (a number or unique name)
2.  purpose of test
3.  description of test
4.  inputs used for test
5.  expected outputs/results
6.  normal/abnormal/boundary case indication
7.  blackbox/whitebox test indication
8.  functional/performance test indication
9.  unit/integration test indication

Note that some of these categories may be inappropriate for your project and may be omitted if you can justify doing so. For items 6-9, only one term should apply.
