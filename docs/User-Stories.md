**User profile:** I am a First year College student, starting my Computer Science (or similar) degree. I have little to no prior experience in programming and I have just started to learn the basics.

**User Story:** Given my background, I face a lot of syntax and logical errors while coding during my assignments. I sometimes do not know the correct or most effective way to approach the soltuion. Hence, I want to have an interactive platoform which can help me learn coding in an efficient manner and help answer my qustions during the assignment, so that I can have strong fundamentals.
