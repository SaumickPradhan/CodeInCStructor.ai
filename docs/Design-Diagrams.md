**Design D0:**

In this highest-level view, we have the Input from the user. It passes through the “Coding Platform” which is the machine. And then the output is the efficient Code recommendation generated from the “Coding Platform”. The “Machine” is depicted in a cloud.

**Design D1:**

In this diagram, we go one layer deep. We understand that the Professor publishes the coding Assignment for the Student. The student can access it via a notebook or a discord bot. The student submits their response to the question on the platform. The platform outputs the tips for coding efficiency with appropriate comments. We understand here that the platform is intrinsic to the assignment given my the professor.

**Design D2:**

Our final design shows the complete working of the subsystems of the platform. The professor publishes the assignment and every student accesses it through their university login ID. The student interacts with the assignment and then submits a response. The response is then passed through an Open API generative API. The API is pre trained on a model which is imported. The model gives the output to the student. The student reviews the comments and implements the code recommendations. The subsystems of the platform are in square boxes.
