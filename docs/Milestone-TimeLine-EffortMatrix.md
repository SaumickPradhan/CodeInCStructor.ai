## Milestone List

1)	**Read the paper:** On Automatic generation of programming exercise. Create a summary of the paper and try to find out the major tasks associated with the paper. Get an idea for the implementation of Codex in our project. 
2)	**Alternative solutions:** Find alternative solutions to the paper and give the results.
3)	**Collect sample I/P – O/P prompts:** Get a sample scenario for the platform’s working from the professors to see its applicability.
4)	**Research the API:** Read up on the APIs to use and its workings. Create test scenarios to show how they work.
5)	**Create sample questions:** Create a way to test some sample questions to generate response.
6)	**Get feedback:** Get feedback on the code submitted. Try to improve the code efficiency. 
7)	**Summarize the response:** Summarize the correct responses from the user for future reference
8)	**Create a prototype UI:** Create a mock UI for the platform for I/P – O/P windows.
9)	**Presentation:** Present the prototype with the mock UI and sample questions at the Expo.
