**Individual Capstone Assessment (Individual project)**

**Name: Saumick Pradhan**

This semester I am a fourth year, and I will be doing my BS senior design project in Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. I am going to extend this work for my Meng Capstone project in Fall 2024. I going to work on an individual project spanning three semesters. This project is the part of the initiative and collaboration of Dr Dean Weidner, Dr William III Hawkins, and Dr Raj Bhatnagar. My goal is to create a working model by early to mid-Spring 2024 and deploy it before Summer 2024. The idea is to create a coding platform which motivates learning and helps provide positive support and encouragement to first year Computer Science students (or any programming related field) learning to code. My advisors and I have decided to test the platform on CS students in Summer, use the data to draw conclusions and then publish my results near graduation.  

 

Throughout my time at UC, I was able to learn various designs of powerful computer languages, skills in data science, operating systems, artificial intelligence and more. My CS 1021C Computer Science 1 in C++, CS 2021 Python Programming and CS 2028C Data Structures class really helped me have a fundamental understanding of structured and object-oriented programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving. Along with that the python concepts like pandas, Numpy, Scipy, and other modules and packages form the basis of my project. Even classes like CS 2071 Discrete Computational Structures and CS 7081 Advanced Algo 1 gave me an in depth understanding of sequential algorithms, analysis of time and space complexity and some major design strategies and algorithms. The EECE 3093C Software Engineering taught me important software lifecycle models, design, testing and maintenance. My classes like CS 6067 User Interface 1 and CS 6027 Requirements Engineering taught me how to understand the end user and present a solution accordingly. Some of the more critical classes contributing to the project are CS 4033 Artificial Intelligence, CS 6073 Deep Learning and CS 6037 Machine learning which cover important ML Algorithms and their implementations along with discussions of concrete problems where these algorithms are suitable. All these skills will be fundamental to the project. 

 

During my COOP with Levi Strauss & Co. AI/ML Center as a Machine Learning Engineer COOP, I developed a ML architecture to eliminate product recommendation error for mis-spelt keywords on Levi.com search bar. I also initiated the creation of Oculus compatible VR shopping experience for Levi’s San Francisco store & presented work to CTO. While working at Digital Scholarship Center at UC as a Machine Learning Engineer, I formulated a ML model to recommend datasets from UC’s library based on user ratings, needs & applicability and generated BERT embeddings and used AWS EC2 instances to train the model in an Agile environment. During my COOP with Tata Consultancy Services as a Software Engineer, I used pandas extensively and learned the implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline. These experiences gave me a hands-on learning on recommendation models using BERT and Word2Vec models and responding to user needs to create a new product. I was also able to publish a research paper, something that is in the scope of this project. The design principles and model architectures that I have experienced working on have helped me see the industry applications of the concepts studied in class. 

 

 

While first learning how to code, there are a lot of things that can be challenging as there are many things to learn. I know every student inevitably faces syntax, logical errors or their solution does not pass all the required test cases. When stuck at the same problem, it can be demotivating, and a lot of students think about giving up the major in the first year. Hence my preliminary approach is to come up with a platform that encourages coding, provides customized feedback, useful hints and additional learning mechanisms. Some of the ideas we have are using Discord Bot, or having a dedicated web App. We plan on using Open AI APIs or used pre trained BERT models (if appropriate data is found, e.g: old tests papers, problems). This platform will be used by students in Summer 2024 and survey data will be collected to publish a paper after drawing conclusions. 

 

My expected results are that by early to mid-Spring 2024, I want to create a working model showing the entire concept. Then, I will work towards deploying it before Summer 2024. This is when I will collect the results and infer conclusions from it to publish a paper near graduation. I will feel accomplished if I am able to provide a working solution to the problem presented by my advisors. I want to see it being implemented in the classrooms and hope to get continuous feedback along the way. I will also feel satisfied if I learn new skills along the way to further my career.
